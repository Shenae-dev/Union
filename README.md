Welcome to the underground.
Nah. Not that underground. Not where dungeon crawlers joyfully hack and slash their way to the goods, the treasure, the kills. That place is a dream.
This is the underground beneath the underground. A place where it's all guts and no glory. This is where the rusty swords and fancy armor come from. This is the manufacturing line on a planet far away that nobody talks about.
Want to try your hand at some real violence? Maybe even try to end it - the most reckless adventure of them all? Come through.
And remember, crawl ethically.

Shift starts in a moment. You're in line waiting to clock in. Which is funny, because time is almost insignificant when you're never actually off the line.
You're standing here with a collection of frenemies, a few true friends peppered among them. "Coworker" is not really an appropriate word amongst people who bang out metal all day and night without freedom or anything resembling life-supporting pay. This is the kind of factory that makes hell look good.
The Overseers are always watching. Sometimes by camera, sometimes standing right next to you. For as long as you can remember, getting free is all anyone wants. And yet nothing changes. That's normal when people have no reason to believe things can change.
But that's not you.
